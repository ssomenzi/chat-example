# lighthouse

This is the source code for a very simple socket.io based server used for
handling signaling between PoC clients developed using vuejs and webrtc.

Lighthouse helps keep clients' vuex stores synced.

This is really basic stuff not suitable for production made just to barely
support development.

I pull in express just for routing. Quite an overkill but... it's just to support development

### test
